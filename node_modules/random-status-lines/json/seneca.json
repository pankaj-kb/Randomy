    "“For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.” The fear should not be of dying. The fear should be of not having lived life enough. We actually die everyday.",
    "“While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time.” We all have a limited amount of time. Yet, we take it for granted, just because the end point is uncertain. Would you still take time for granted if you knew when it would end",
    "“The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company.” There is a difference in being alone and being lonely. Don’t lose any opportunity for solitude!",
    "“It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor.” Know what is enough. Don’t just know it, put a number on it. Otherwise, you will always find yourself chasing.",
    "“Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.” If you let your wants become your needs, you will always be wanting.",
    "“No man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she did not threaten him as greatly as she had previously indulged him.” Whatever Fate has given you, it can easily take away from you. It's yours on rent, not to own.",
    "“He is a great man who uses earthenware dishes as if they were silver; but he is equally great who uses silver as if it were earthenware.” If Fate has given you riches, enjoy it. Don’t shun your good fortune. But don’t be dependent on it.",
    "“There are more things, Lucilius, likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality.” We live our problems in our minds even before we come across them.",
    "The problems might come. They might not come. But we have already lived through them in our minds. And if they do actually come, we go through them twice - once in our imagination, once in reality.",
    "“It's the idle report that disturbs us most. For truth has its own definite boundaries, but that which arises from uncertainty is delivered over to the irresponsible license of a frightened mind.” In reality, our problems have limits. In our imaginations, they have none. ",
    "“And even though it is ordained to be, what does it avail to run out to meet your suffering? You will suffer soon enough, when it arrives; so look forward meanwhile to better things.” Anticipate problems, but don’t live them before they even arrive.",
    "“Let another say : Perhaps the worst will not happen , You yourself must say. : Well, what if it does happen?” Think of the worst-case scenario. Most of the times, it is not as bad as you fear it to be.",
    "“What Chance has made yours is not really yours.” Whatever Fate has given you, it can easily take away from you too.",
    "If you would be loved, love.",
    "The fool, with all his other faults, has this also, he is always getting ready to live. Do plan for tomorrow but don’t forget to live for today.",
    "If you live according to nature, you will never be poor; if you live according to opinion, you will never be rich. , You will never have enough as long as you are competing with your neighbour.",
    "If you wish to have leisure for your mind, either be a poor man, or resemble a poor man. Reduce your wants, stick to the needs",
    "The acquisition of riches has been for many men, not an end, but a change, of troubles. You either crave for more or fear losing what you have",
    "“There are a few men whom slavery holds fast, but there are many more who hold fast to slavery.” There is only one way to win the rat race - by quitting it",
    "“Men do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it is within the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man's power to live long.” Focus on the quality of your life; not quantity. The former is in your hands, the latter isn’t.",
    "“One must not talk to a man unless he is willing to listen.” Enough said."
