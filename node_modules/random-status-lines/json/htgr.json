    "From Naval Ravikant\nHow to Get Rich (without getting lucky)\nSeek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.\nUnderstand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.\nIgnore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.\nYou’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.\nYou will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.\nPick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.\nThe Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.\nPlay iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.\nPick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.\nDon't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.\nLearn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.\nArm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.\nSpecific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.\nSpecific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.\nBuilding specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.\nWhen specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.\nSpecific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.\nEmbrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.\nThe most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.\n“Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” - Archimedes\nFortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).\nCapital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.\nLabor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.\nCapital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.\nCode and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.\nAn army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.\nIf you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.\nLeverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.\nJudgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.\nThere is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.\nStudy microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.\nReading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.\nYou should be too busy to do coffee, while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.\nSet and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.\nWork as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.\nBecome the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.\nThere are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you.\nApply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.\nWhen you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day."
