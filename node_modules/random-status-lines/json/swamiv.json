    "All knowledge that the world has ever received comes from the mind; the infinite library of the universe is in our own mind.",
    "There is no limit to the power of the human mind. The more concentrated it is, the more power is brought to bear on one point.",
    "Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of it; live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.",
    "Dare to be free, dare to go as far as your thought leads, and dare to carry that out in your life.",
    "Be not afraid of anything. You will do marvelous work. It is fearlessness that brings heaven even in a moment.",
    "Each work has to pass through these stages—ridicule, opposition, and then acceptance. Those who think ahead of their time are sure to be misunderstood.",
    "Learn everything that is good from others, but bring it in, and in your own way absorb it; do not become others.",
    "Anything that makes you weak, physically, intellectually and spiritually, reject it as poison.",
    "You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make you spiritual.",
    "What we want is neither happiness nor misery. Both make us forget our true nature, both are chains; behind both is the Atman, who knows neither happiness nor misery. These are states, and states must ever change; but the nature of the Atman is bliss, peace, unchanging... ...We have not to get it, we have it; only wash away the dross and see it.",
    "Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free. This is the whole of religion... Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details.",
    "Was there ever a more horrible blasphemy than the statement that all the knowledge of God is confined to this or that book? How dare men call God infinite, and yet try to compress him within the covers of a little book!",
    "We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.",
    "The fire that warms us can also consume us; it is not the fault of the fire.",
    "Desire, ignorance, and inequality—this is the trinity of bondage.",
    "The greatest truths are the simplest things in the world, simple as your own existence.",
    "In a conflict between the heart and the brain, follow your heart.",
    "The cheerful mind perseveres and the strong mind hews its way through a thousand difficulties."
