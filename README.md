yes, we know Working with Files using JavaScript is a very Tedious Task
How about I make it Simple for you ??
just use my Randomy API
Scroll Through My code and Change files as you want
now whatever Contents from a file you wanted to be displayed Randomly from a file is now available
Just for Example - I created this API to send Quotes and Twitter threads from JSON file to a Webpage which will be later collected by my Telegram bot to Show to User.
